# walker_droplets
The following is an ongoing project whose goal is to predict the "chaotic" trajectories of oil walker droplets<br>
in a circular corral.  These droplets are described as hydrodynamic quantum analogs. Some strange behaviors observed<br> 
which are fun to look at are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2yYgfaU6Ik) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP-NZ5EoTm4).<br>

### What are walker droplets?
The walker droplets are created using a fluid such as silicon oil in a bath, placed on a vibration table. The table<br> vibrates at around 60 HZ vertically.  When a pointed object such as a toothpick is dipped into the oil a droplet will<br>
fall off and if the timing is right, will fall into a trough and begin bouncing on a cushion of air without coalescing<br> into the bath. In various experiments the droplet can contineue propogating for days. A key point is to keep the vibration<br> below the Faraday threshold of the corral, thereby creating standing waves which interfere with the trajectories.<br>
If this limit maintained the droplets will explore the corral/bath with "chaotic" trajectories.  It is true that the statistics of these trajectories mimic the statitistics of a particle in a quantum corral.

### Why do they travel?
